#thannks you so much for the oportunity

-I chose  angular 1.5.x (components) and angular-material
- i created a model "Notification" with some methods to get the proper message to display 
-call the api (mock data) and property format the data to display in the view
- after trying the "clear all" button, if you want to get back the notifications please refresh the page


I hope that the work meets your expectations,
